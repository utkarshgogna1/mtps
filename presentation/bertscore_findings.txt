Here Are some key points from the evaluation of summarized test texts that could be useful:

OVERALL PERFORMANCE:
- The model achieves an average F1 Score of 0.8145, indicating good semantic alignment 
between summaries and transcriptions.

- Precision (0.8311) is higher than Recall (0.7988), suggesting the model generates 
relevant content but may omit some key details.

- The average Compression Ratio is 16.7157, indicating the summaries are approximately 
17 times shorter than the original transcriptions, reflecting strong conciseness.

HIGH-PERFORMING FILES:

transcription_test_DanBarber_2010_S103_6s:
    - F1 Score: 0.8633 (highest in the set).
    - Compression Ratio: 2.9130 (lowest in the set).
    - The summary is nearly as detailed as the original text, likely due to the brevity of the transcription.
    
transcription_test_GaryFlake_345s:
    - F1 Score: 0.8237.
    - Compression Ratio: 17.3488 (moderate), indicating a concise summary with high semantic retention.


LOW-PERFORMING FILES:

transcription_test_JamesCameron_982s:
    - F1 Score: 0.7882 (lowest in the set).
    - Compression Ratio: 24.2705 (highest in the set).
    - The high compression ratio suggests over-condensation, likely omitting key details, reflected in the 
    lower recall (0.7754).


GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:

Compression Ratio and Recall Correlation:
    - High compression ratios (e.g., JamesCameron_982s, 24.2705) tend to correlate with lower recall, as key details are lost during summarization.
        
    - Files with moderate compression ratios (e.g., GaryFlake_345s, 17.3488) balance recall and conciseness well.
    
Short Transcriptions Perform Better:
    - Shorter transcriptions like DanBarber_2010_S103_6s achieve better F1 scores (0.8633), as the summaries retain more details.
    
Balanced Compression Ratios (~15â€“18):
    - Files like transcription_test_AimeeMullins_1249s (15.8770) and transcription_test_JaneMcGonigal_1168s (16.0565) demonstrate good balance between conciseness and semantic retention.
