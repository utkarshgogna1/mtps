Nathaniel Anthony Ayers dropped out of Julliard after suffering a complete breakdown. 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles. Ayers'' manic rage was transformed into understanding, into understanding and acquired curiosity. "For Nathaniel, music is sanity, Because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity into reality, And that is an escape from his tormented state," she says. "I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney concert hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician"
