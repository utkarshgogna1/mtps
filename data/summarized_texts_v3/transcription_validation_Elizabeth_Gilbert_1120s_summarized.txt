"I am my writer. Writing books is my profession, but it's more than that, of course. It is also my great lifelong love and fascination, And I don't expect that's ever going to change" "Everywhere I go now, people treat me: I'm doomed, Seriously doomed, doomed.

He says we can't erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech. Leonard Cohen: "For most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist" Cohen: One day he was driving on the freeway in Los Angeles, and he heard this little fragment of melody that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing.

The Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah, Allah to ole. If the divine cock-eyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts, then Olay. And if not, do you dance anyhow.
