There are several cognitive traps that make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory. And the third is it's the focusing illusion. There's just no way of getting it right. In a life there are about 600 million of them, and in a month there, about 600 thousand. Most of the moments of our life are said to be about three seconds long. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. We don't choose between memories of experiences and memories of experience. "Why do we put much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences?" "Happiness is not about how happy a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased a person is, when that person thinks about her life" "We have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves" Happiness is mainly being satisfied with people, that we're spending time with people. If you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. The most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find.
