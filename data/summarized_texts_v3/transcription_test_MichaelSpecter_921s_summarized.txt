This is the greatest time there's ever been on the planet, by any measure that you wish to choose. There's never been a time this. Despite all our accomplishments, a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day. A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. The New Yorker's John Sutter says he's been disturbed by anti-vaccine sentiment. Sutter: "We're now in an epidemic of fear, one that I've never seen and hope never to see again" He says the U.S. is one of few countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down. Bob Greene says vaccines are essential. You take them away, disease comes back-horrible diseases, and that's happening. We have measles in this country now, and it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids are going to die again, because it's just a numbers game, Greene says. Every grain of rice, every sprig of parsley, every brussels sprout has been modified by man. We object to genetically engineered food. Why do we do that? The things I constantly hear are too many chemicals, pesticides, hormones, monoculture. We do not want giant fields of the same thing. This is about keeping people alive, And it's about time we started to understand what that meant. It's selfish, it's ugly, It's beneath us, and we really have to stop it. I know that we can and as far as I'm concerned. That's something the world needs right now.
