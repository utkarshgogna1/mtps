Microsoft's new technology, See dragon, lets you interact with vast amounts of visual data. See dragon is a project called Photosynth which marries two different technologies. We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish that should be necessary. Microsoft has created a map of the world based on flicker images. The map was created by combining images from a variety of cameras. The aim is to create a cross-model and cross-user social and cross user social experience. The project is based on Stephen Lawler's virtual Earth work.
