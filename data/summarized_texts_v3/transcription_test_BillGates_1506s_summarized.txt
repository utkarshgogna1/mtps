The world has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9.3 billion. If we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare services, we could lower the price of energy by about 10% or 15%. We've got to go from rapidly rising to falling and falling all the way to 0. Poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet. We probably could cut back and use less. But every year this number on average is going to go out. That will more than double the services delivered per person. We need energy miracles. Renewable energy sources have some disadvantages, such as the density of energy gather. Nuclear energy also has three big problems, including cost, safety and waste. Storage of energy is a big problem, and we need a breakthrough. What we need is hundreds of companies working on these five paths. The world needs to cut its CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050. To get to that 80%, developed countries will have to switch their electricity generation all together. We need to go from more research funding to more innovation. If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years, I can pick whose president. We do need the market incentives: CO2 tax, cap and trade, something that gets that price signal out there. We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue, including the steps that the government takes. This is an important wish, but it is one we can achieve. The tough thing is building the pilot reactor. Minerals have a million times as much energy as coal. Geoengineering techniques could delay the heating to bias 20 or 30 years to get our act together. U.S. should spend $10 billion more on R&D than it is right now.
