We spend three billion hours a week playing online games. If we want to survive the next century on this planet, we need to increase that total dramatically. I've calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of gameplay every week. I believe that we need a spire to play games online for at least twenty-one billion hours by the end of the next decade. The average young person in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21. By spending all this time playing games, we're changing what we are capable of as human beings. 500 million people who are perfect at something. In the next decade we're going to have another billion gamers. The average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week- a half-time job. Gamers love to be attached to awe-inspiring missions.

This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage. The oil shortage is fictional, but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it's real and to live your real life as if we run out of oil.
