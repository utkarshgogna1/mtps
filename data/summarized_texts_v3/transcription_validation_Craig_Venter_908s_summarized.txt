We've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. This is the map of a small organism, Mycoplasma genitalium- that has the smallest genome for a species that can self-replicate in the laboratory. Scientists have created a way to make large genetic code pieces that can be put together automatically. This is the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure. We can use the genetic code to write out words, sentences, thoughts. We are trying to get to the point of automation. Scientists have created a database with about 20 million genes and I to think of these as the design components of the future. We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day. We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion plus barrels of oil. Furthermore, we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of what is life. Furthermore, we're a ways away from improving people. Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that.
