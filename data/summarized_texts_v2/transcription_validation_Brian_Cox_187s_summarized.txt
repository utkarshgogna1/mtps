The LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted: 27 kilometers in circumference. Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began. On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time and this picture was taken by Atlas. A week later we had a problem with the machine related to these bits of wire here, these gold wires. Those wires carry 13,000 amps when the machine's working at full power, when the machines work in full power.
