Microsoft's new technology, See dragon, lets you interact with vast amounts of visual data. It's also a very flexible architecture. We're looking at many, many gigabytes of digital photos here and seamlessly and continuously zooming and panning through the thing, rearranging it any way we want. It doesn't matter how much. The only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system-this one-is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment. We hope that this means no more pop-ups and other rubbish that should be necessary. This is now taking data from everybody, from the entire collective memory of visually of what the Earth looks, and link all of that together. All of those photos become linked together, and they make something emergent that's greater than the sum of the parts. You have a model that emerges of the entire Earth. Think of this as the long tail to Stephen Lawler's virtual Earth work. That grows in complexity as people use it and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it.
