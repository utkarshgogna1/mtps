"I'm convinced that there's some pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking, and I understand that I'm not part of that crowd" "I want to get in the machine and I want to go forward. This is the greatest time there's ever been on the planet, By any measure that you wish to choose" "We've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe. Potable water, arable land, rain, forest oil, gas-They're going away, And they are going away soon" CNN's John Sutter talks about the dangers of vaccines and genetically engineered food. Sutter: We're at a point in this world where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to. We've lost faith in institutions, in authority and sometimes in science itself, and there's no reason we shouldn't have, Sutter says. The U.S. is one of the few countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down, and we should be ashamed of ourselves, he says. In the next 50 years, we're going to have to grow 70% more food than we do right now- 70%. This is investment in Africa over the last 30 years. And why Genetically engineered food? We don't want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff. This isn't about rice crispier. This is about keeping people alive. And it's about time we started to understand what that meant, because something, if we continue to act the way we're acting, we are guilty of something that I'm guilty of: High-tech colonialism. It's selfish, it's ugly, It's beneath us, and we really have to stop it.
