He said, OK, I'm going to go be a full-time explorer. We started planning these expeditions, and we wound up going to Bismarck with robotic vehicles. With robotic vehicles, we went back to the wreck of the Titanic. We had created that spool of optic spooled and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship. "I felt I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic, and it was the most surreal DJ VU experience I've ever had" "I learn a lot about science, but I also learned a little bit of a glimpse to what might be happening some decades out, as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means" "You're doing it for the task itself, For the challenge- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is- for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens" "It completely changed how I do movies. Tremendously exciting, tremendously challenging- and we became a family over a four and a half year period," he says. "I have young filmmakers come up to me and say: give me some advice for doing this," he adds. "And I say: don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you. Don't do it to yourself"
