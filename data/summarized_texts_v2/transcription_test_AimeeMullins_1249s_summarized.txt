Sara Pescara says she never looked up the word disabled to see what she'd find. She says she was born into a world that perceived someone-me- to have nothing positive going for them. Her childhood doctor at the AI DuPont Institute opened doors for her. The human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. Our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity, but preparing them to meet it. Amy Mullins was born without the Cable of Bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and few toes on that. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we, as humans, have always required of our community members is to be of use. Mullins: Adversity is just changed that we haven't adapted ourselves to. The only true disability is a crushed spirit. A spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope, It doesn't see beauty. If, instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imaginative, then we are truly using our power. When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new.
