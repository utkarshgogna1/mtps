Reference Summary:

The speaker shares a powerful personal reflection on the impact of language and societal attitudes on people with disabilities. She begins by recounting her experience of looking up the definition of "disabled" in an old thesaurus, finding it filled with negative and disempowering terms. This prompts a broader discussion about how words shape beliefs, identity, and societal perceptions. The speaker contrasts these limiting descriptions with her own experiences of overcoming challenges and being empowered by others, especially her childhood doctor, who encouraged her to see herself as strong and capable.

She argues that adversity is not something to be avoided but embraced, as it helps shape our identities and builds resilience. She highlights how technology and medical advancements have allowed people with disabilities to thrive, which language and societal attitudes have not yet fully recognized. The speaker challenges the idea of "normalcy," suggesting that embracing diversity and recognizing the value of every individual can lead to a more inclusive society.

She concludes by emphasizing that the only true disability is a "crushed spirit" and that it is our responsibility to empower others, especially children, by seeing and nurturing their potential. The speaker encourages everyone to shift their perspective from focusing on overcoming adversity to embracing and transforming it, thereby unlocking human potential. She ends with a poem that invites everyone to "come, dance with me," celebrating the power and adaptability of the human spirit.
