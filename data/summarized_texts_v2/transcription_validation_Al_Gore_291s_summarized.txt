The Arctic Ice cap is, in a sense, of the beating heart of the global climate system. It expands in winter and contracts in summer. In the last five years, we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours, 25 million tons every day to the oceans. The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20% of it, is the burning of fossil fuels. Oil is a problem and coal is the most serious problem. The coal industry and the oil industry spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal. If you want to go far, go together. We need to gopher quickly. Thank you very much.
