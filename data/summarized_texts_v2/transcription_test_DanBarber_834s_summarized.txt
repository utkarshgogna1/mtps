CNN's John Sutter fell in love with a fish farm in southern Spain. The fish was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. Sutter wanted to support the company, but the fish tasted like chicken to him. The company's PR man said there's just too much chicken in the world, Sutter says. 'I fell out of love with this fish, Not because I'm some self-righteous goody-two-shoes foodie,' Sutter writes, 'because I swear to God, after that conversation, the fish taste chicken' In 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. They reversed the flow of water. Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. The farm's incredible. You've never seen anything. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp, the shrimp eat the phytoplankton, the pink of the belly, the better the system. A farm that measures its success on the health of its animals is a bird sanctuary. CNN's John Sutter asks: How are we going to feed the world? Sutter: We need a radically new conception of agriculture, one in which the food tastes good. He says the model for the agribusiness model is ancient, tired, and high on capital. Sutter says instead of just extensively intensively farming, we need to use land and water more extensively instead of relying on expensive machines and machines to produce food. The future of our food system is in the hands of farmers, he says. I'm okay with that, Because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious, Thank you.
