We've been digitizing biology, and now we're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life. We started down the road of: can we synthesize chromosome? Can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we've never been before? And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome? A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material. Our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace. Our ability to write the genetic code has been moved. Scientists have created a way to put together large pieces of DNA. The process is called genomic alchemy. It could lead to a new version of the Cambrian explosion, where there's a massive explosion of speciation where there are thousands of new traits added in a second to a species. This is building on three and a half billion years of evolution. We're about to go from six to nine billion years, over the next 40 years. We are trying to get to the point of automation. I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space. We use over five billion tons of coal, 30 billion plus barrels of oil, That's 100 million barrels a day. When we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that, it's going to be a huge challenge. We now have techniques, because of these rapid methods of synthesis, to do what we're calling combinatorial genomics. We think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of what is life. Our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that.
