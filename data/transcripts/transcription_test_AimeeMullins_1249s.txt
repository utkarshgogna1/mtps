Original text:
 i'd like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for italian wired i always keep my thesaurus handy whenever i'm writing anything but i'd already finished editing the piece and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what i'd find let me read you the entry disabled adjective crippled helpless useless wrecked stalled maimed wounded mangled lame mutilated rundown worn out weakened impotent castrated paralyzed handicapped senile decrepit laid up done up done for done in cracked up counted out see also hurt useless and weak antonyms healthy strong capable i was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing it was so ludicrous but i just gotten past mangled and my voice broke and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock uh and and impact that the assault from these words unleashed you know hum of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus i'm thinking this must be an ancient print date right but in fact the print date was the early nineteen eighties when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me and needless to say thank god i wasn't using a thesaurus back then i mean from this entry it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them when in fact today i'm celebrated for uh the opportunities and adventures my life has procured so uh i immediately went to look up the two thousand and nine uh online edition expecting to find a revision worth noting here's the updated version of this entry unfortunately it's not much better i find the the last two words under near antonyms particularly unsettling whole and wholesome so it's not just about the words it's what we believe about people when we name them with these words it's about the values behind the words and how we construct those values our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people in fact many ancient societies including the greeks and the romans believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence so what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited or a person who's empowered by casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a i dupont institute in wilmington delaware his name is doctor pizzutillo hum it's an italian american whose name apparently was too difficult for most americans to pronounce so he went by doctor p and doctor p always wore really colorful bow ties and hum had the very perfect disposition to work with children i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital with the exception of my physical therapy sessions i had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick elastic bands uh different colors you know to help build up my leg muscles and i hated these bands more than anything i hated them had names for them i hated them and you know i was already bargaining as a five year old child with doctor p to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully of course and one day he came in to my session hum exhaustive and unforgiving these sessions and he said to me wow aimee you are such a strong powerful little girl i think you're going to break one of those bands when you do break it i'm going to give you a hundred bucks now of course this this was a simple ploy on doctor p's part to get me to do the exercises i didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five year old in the second floor ward but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me and i have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong powerful and athletic person well into the future this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child but in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society many of which have been brought about by technology certainly from a medical standpoint my legs hum you know laser surgery for vision impairment uh titanium knee and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self identify to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing so perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset the human ability to adapt it's an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and i'm going to make an admission this phrase never sat right with me and i always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and i think i'm starting to figure out why implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability but in fact we are changed we are marked of course by a challenge whether physically emotionally or both and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life it's part of our life and i tend to think of it like my shadow sometimes i see a lot of it sometimes there's very little but it's always with me and certainly i'm not trying to diminish the impact the weight of a person's struggle there is adversity and challenge in life and it's all very real and relative to every single person but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity but how you're going to meet it so our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt there's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i'm disabled and truthfully the only real and consistent disability i've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed a prognosis on the expected quality of their life we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself by not treating the wholeness of a person by not acknowledging their potency we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have we are effectively grading someone's worth to our community so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability and most importantly there's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability so it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it embracing it grappling with it to use a wrestling term maybe even dancing with it and perhaps if we see adversity as natural consistent and useful we're less burdened by the presence of it this year we celebrate the two hundreth birthday of charles darwin and it was one hundred and fifty years ago when writing about evolution that darwin illustrated i think a truth about the human character to paraphrase it's not the strongest of the species that survives nor is it the most intelligent that survives it is the one that is most adaptable to change conflict is the genesis of creation from darwin's work amongst others we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation so again transformation adaptation is our greatest human skill and perhaps you know until we're tested we don't know what we're made of maybe that's what adversity gives us a sense of self a sense of our own power so we can give ourselves a gift we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times maybe we can see it as change adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet i think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy now who's normal there's no normal there's common there's typical there's no normal and would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed i don't think so if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use to be able to contribute there's evidence that neanderthals sixty thousand years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community they didn't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable few years ago i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in northeastern pennsylvania and i was standing over a bushel of tomatoes it was summer time i had shorts on i hear this guy his voice behind me say well if it isn't aimee mullins and i turn around and it's this older man i have no idea who he is and i said i'm sorry sir  i don't have we met i i don't remember meeting you he said well you wouldn't remember meeting me i mean when we met i was delivering you from your mother's womb oh that guy and but of course actually it did click this man was doctor kean a man i had only known about through my mother's stories of that day because of course typical fashion i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks an so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents and because i was born without the fibula bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that he had to be the bearer this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news he said to me i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence and you've been making liar out of me ever since the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood whether winning a second grade spelling bee marching with the girl scouts you know the halloween parade winning my college scholarship or any of my sports victories and he was using it and integrating it into teaching uh resident students med students from hahnemann medical school and hershey medical school and he called this part of the course the x factor the potential of the human will no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be and a as a determinant in the quality of someone's life and doctor kean went on to tell me that he said in my experience unless repeatedly told otherwise and even if given a modicum of support if left to their own devices a child will achieve see doctor kean made that shift in thinking he understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it and there's been a shift in my thinking over time in that if you'd asked me at fifteen years old if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs i wouldn't have hesitated for a second i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then if you ask me today i'm not so sure and it's because of the experiences i've had with them not in spite of the experiences i've had with them and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me see all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off if you can hand somebody the key to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment you are educating them in the best sense you're teaching them to open doors for themselves in fact the the exact meaning of the word educate comes from the root word educe it means to bring forth what is within to bring out potential so again which potential do we want to bring out there was a case study done in nineteen sixties in britain when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools it's called the streaming trials we call it tracking here in the states it's separating students from a b c d and so on and you know the a students get the tougher curriculum the best teachers etc well they took over a three month period d level students gave them a's told them they were a's told them they were bright and at the end of this three month period they were performing at a level and of course the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the a students and told them they were d's and that's what happened at the end of that three month period those who were still around in school besides the people who had dropped out this is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too the teachers didn't know a switch had been made they were simply told these are the a students these are the d students and that's how they went about teaching them and treating them so i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope it doesn't see beauty it no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine if instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope to see beauty in themselves and others to be curious and imaginative then we are truly using our power well when a spirit has those qualities we are able to create new realities and new ways of being i'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth century persian poet named hafiz that my friend jacques dembois told me about and the poem is called the god who only knows four words every child has known god not the god of names not the god of don'ts but the god who only knows four words and keeps repeating them saying come dance with me come dance with me thank you

Whisper transcription:
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired. I always keep my bizarre as handy whenever I'm writing anything, but I'd already finished editing the piece and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word disabled to see what I'd find. Let me read you the entry. Disabled, agitive, crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked, stalled, Rect, stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated, run down, worn out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped, senile, decrepit, laid up, don up, done for, done in, cracked up, counted out. See also hurt, useless, hurt, useless, and weak. Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable. I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing, it was so ludicrous, but I just got and passed mangled when my voice broke and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words that the assault from these words unleashed. You know, and of course, this is my raggedy old Tsara, so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right? But in fact, the print date was the early 1980s when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids in the world around me, and needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a Tsara's back then. back then. I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them. When, in fact, today, I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life have procured. So I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision and expecting to find a revision worth noting, here's the updated version of this entry. Unfortunately, it's not much better. I find the last two words under near-antonyms, particularly unsettling, whole, and wholesome. So, It's not just about the words. It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words, about the values behind the words and how we construct those values. and struck those values, our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how you view other people. In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans, believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence. So what reality do we want to call into existence? A person who is limited or a person or a person who's empowered. By casually doing something as simple as naming a person a child, we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power. Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead? Once that person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware. His name is Dr. where? His name is Dr. Pete Zotillo. I'm a Italian American whose name apparently was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce, so he went by Dr. P. And Dr.P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital, which the exception of my physical therapy sessions. I had to do sessions. I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick, elastic bands, different colors, you know, to help build up my leg muscles. And I hated these bands more than anything. I hated them, had names for them, I hate them. And you know I was already bargaining as a five-year-old child with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises unsuccessfully, of course. And one day he came in to my he came in to my session, exhaustive and unforgiving these sessions. And he said to me, wow, Amy, you are such a strong, powerful little girl. I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it, I'm going to give you 100 bucks. Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old before the prospect of being the richest fighter old in the second floor award. But what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me. And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong as an inherently strong, powerful, and athletic person well into the future. This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child. But in the previous instances of those Bessara centuries, our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want. The possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable. is capable. Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society, many of which have been brought about by technology. Certainly from a medical standpoint, my legs, you know, laser surgery for vision impairment, titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them. Not to mention Not to mention social networking platforms. It allows people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing. So perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth. That everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society. And that the human ability to adapt is our greatest to adapt is our greatest asset. A human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity and I'm going to make an admission. This phrase never sat right with me and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity is the of overcoming adversity is the idea that success or happiness is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience. As if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics or what other people perceive as my disability. But in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, We are marked, of course, by a challenge, whether physically, emotionally, or both. And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing. Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life. It's part of our life, and I tend to think of it like my shadow. Sometimes I see a lot of it. Sometimes there's very little, but it's always with me. Now, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish Now, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight of a person's struggle. There is adversity and challenge in life, and it's all very real and relative to every single person, but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity, but how you're gonna meet it. So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity but preparing them to meet it well. to meet it well. And we do it to service to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt. There's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled. And truthfully, the only real and The only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis or indeed prognoses on the expected quality of their life, we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone. Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself. By not treating the wholeness of a person, by not acknowledging their potency, we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have. We are effectively grating are effectively grading someone's worth to our community. So we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability. And most importantly, there's a partnership between those perceived efficiencies and our greatest creative ability. So it's not about devaluing or negating these more trying times as something we want trying time is something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug, but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity. So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it, embracing it, grappling with it, these are wrestling terms, maybe even dancing with it. And perhaps if we see adversity And perhaps if we see adversity as natural, consistent, and useful, we're less burdened by the presence of it. This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin. And it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution, the Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character to paraphrase. It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor is it the most intelligent nor is it the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. Conflict is the genesis of creation. From Darwin's work amongst others, we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation. So again, transformation So again, transformation, adaptation is our greatest human skill. And perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of. Maybe that's what adversity gives us. A sense of self, a sense of our own power. So we can give ourselves a gift. We can reimagine adversity as something more than just tough times. Maybe we can see it as change. Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy. But who's normal? There's no normal. There's common. There is typical. And would you want to meet that poor beige person if they existed? I don't think so. I don't think so. If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency to be even a little bit more dangerous, we can release the power of so many more children and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. Anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use. members is to be of use, to be able to contribute. There's evidence that Neanderthals 60,000 years ago carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury. And perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community. They didn't view these people as broken and useless. They were seen as rare and valuable. were seen as rare and valuable. A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania. And I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime. I had shorts on. I heard this guy, his voice behind me say, well, if it isn't Amy Mullins, I turn around. And this is older man. I have no idea who he is. I said, I'm sorry, sir. Have we met? I don't remember meeting you. He said, well you wouldn't remember meeting you. He said, well, you wouldn't remember meeting me. I mean, when we met, I was delivering you from your mother's womb. Oh, that guy. And of course, actually, it did click. This man was Dr. Keane, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day. Because of course typical fashion. I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks. And so my mother prenatal physician had gone on vacation. had gone on vacation. So the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents. And because I was born without the Cable of Bones and had feet turned in and a few toes in this foot and few toes on that, he had to be the bearer, the stranger, had to bearer of bad news. He said to me, I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk and you would have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence. or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making a liar out of me ever since. The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clipping throughout my whole childhood, whether winning a second grade spelling bee, marching with the Girl Scouts, the Halloween parade, winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories, and he was using it, integrating it into teaching resident students, med students from Hanuman Medical School, in medical school and Hershey, medical school. And he called this part of the course the X-Factor. It was the potential of the human will. No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone's life. And Dr. Keen went on to tell me that he said in my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise. And even if given a modicum of support, it's left to their own devices, a child will achieve. See, Dr. Keane made that shift in thinking. He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it. And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, and that if you would ask me, at 15 years old, if I would have traded, If I would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second. I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then. But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure. And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experience I've have with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cash shadows on me. See, all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power and you're off. If you can hand somebody the key to their own power, the human spirit is so receptive, if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment, open a door for someone at a crucial moment, you are educating them in the best sense. You're teaching them to open doors for themselves. In fact, the exact meaning of the word educate comes from the root word deduce. It means to bring forth what is within. To bring out potential. So again, which potential do we want to bring out? There was a case study done in 1960. There was a case study done in 1960s, Britain, when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools. It's called the streaming trials. We call it tracking here in the states, it's separating students from A, B, C, D, and so on. And, you know, the A students get the top curriculum, the best teachers, et cetera. Well, they took over a three-month period. D-level students gave them A's. Told them they were A's, told them they And at the end of this three-month period, they were performing at a level. And of course, the heartbreaking flip side of this study is that they took the A students and told them they were D's. And that's what happened. At the end that three month period, those who were still around in school, besides the drop, people had dropped out. This is a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped to. two. The teachers didn't know a switch had been made. They were simply told, these are the A students. These are the D students. And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. So I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit. A spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope. It doesn't see beauty. It no longer has our natural childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine. If instead we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope, to see beauty in themselves and others, to be curious and imaginative, then we are truly using our power well. When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new We are able to create new realities and new ways of being. I'd like to leave you with a poem by a 14th century Persian poet named Hafiz. And my friend, Jacques Dombois, told me about. And the poem is called The God Who Only Knows Four Words. Every child has known God. Not the God of names. But the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, come, dance with me. Come. Dance with me, thank you.
