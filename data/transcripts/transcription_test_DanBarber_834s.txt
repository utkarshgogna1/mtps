 so i've known a lot of fish in my life i've loved only two that first one was a it was more like a passionate affair it was a beautiful fish flavorful textured meaty a best seller on the menu what a fish even better it was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability so you could feel good about selling it i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months one day the head of the company called and asked if i'd speak at an event about the farm's sustainability absolutely i said here was a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for our chefs how do we keep fish on our menus for the past fifty years we've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests it's hard to overstate the destruction ninety percent of large fish the ones we love the tunas the halibuts the salmons swordfish they've collapsed there was nothing left so for better or for worse aquaculture fish farming is going to be a part of our future a lot of arguments against it fish farms pollute most of them do anyway and they're inefficient take tuna a major drawback it's got a feed conversion ratio of fifteen to one that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna not very sustainable doesn't taste very good either so here finally was a company trying to do it right i wanted to support them the day before the event i called the head of pr for the company let's call him don don i said just to get the facts straight you guys are famous for for farming so far out to sea you you don't pollute that's right he said we're so far out the waste from our fish gets distributed not concentrated and then he added we're basically a world unto ourselves that feed conversion ratio two point five to one he said best in the business two point five to one great two point five to one what what are you feeding sustainable proteins he said great i said got off the phone and that night i was lying in bed and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein so the next day just before the event i called don i said don what are some examples of sustainable proteins he said he didn't know he would ask around well i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally i got on the phone with the head biologist let's call him don too don i said what are some examples of sustainable proteins well he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals and then he said chicken pellets i said chicken pellets he said yeah feathers skin bone meal scraps dried and processed into feed i said what percentage of your feed is chicken thinking you know two percent well it's about thirty percent he said i said don what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish there there was a long pause on the line and he said there's just too much chicken in the world i fell out of love with this fish no not because i'm some self righteous goody two shoes foodie i actually am no i fell out of love with this fish because i swear to god after that conversation the fish tasted like chicken this second fish it's a different kind of love story it's the romantic kind the kind where the more you get to know your fish you love the fish i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time she kind of set us up ok it came to the table a bright almost shimmering white color the chef had overcooked it like twice over ok amazingly it was still delicious who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked i can't but this guy can let's call him miguel actually his name is miguel and no he didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef at least in the way that you and i understand it he's a biologist at veta la palma it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of spain it's at the tip of the guadalquivir river until the nineteen eighties the farm was in the hands of the argentinians they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands they did it by draining the land they built this intricate series of canals and they pushed water off the land and out into the river well they couldn't make it work not economically and ecologically it was a disaster killed like ninety percent of the birds which for this place is a lot of birds and so in nineteen eighty two a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land what did they do they reversed the flow of water they literally flipped the switch instead of pushing water out they used the channels to pull water back in they flooded the canals they created a twenty seven thousand acre fish farm bass mullet shrimp eel and in the process miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction the farm's incredible i mean you've never seen anything like this you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick rich marshland i was there not long ago with miguel he's an amazing guy like three parts charles darwin and one part crocodile dundee okay there we are slogging through the wetlands and i'm panting and sweating got mud up to my knees and miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture here he's pointing out a rare black shouldered kite now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton and here here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe it turns out miguel spent the better part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa i asked him how he became such an expert on fish he said fish i didn't know anything about fish i'm an expert in relationships and then he's off launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants and don't get me wrong that was really fascinating you know the biotic community unplugged kind of thing you know it's great but i was in love and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish i had the night before so i interrupted him i said miguel what makes your fish taste so good he pointed at the algae i know dude the algae the phytoplankton the relationships it's amazing but what are your fish eating what's the feed conversion ratio well he goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild the plant biomass the phytoplankton the zooplankton it's what feeds the fish the system is so healthy it's totally self renewing there there is no feed ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals unlike like any fish any farm i'd ever been at how do you measure success at that moment it was as if a film director called for a set change and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see that's success he said look at their bellies pink they're feasting feasting i was totally confused i said miguel aren't they feasting on your fish yes he said we lose twenty percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds well the last year this property had six hundred thousand birds on it more than two hundred and fifty different species it's become today the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of europe i said miguel isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm he shook his head no he said we farm extensively not intensively this is an ecological network the flamingos eat the shrimp the shrimp eat the phytoplankton so the pinker the belly the better the system okay so let's review a farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators a fish farm but also a bird sanctuary oh and by the way those flamingos they shouldn't even be there in the first place they brood in a town a hundred and fifty miles away where the soil conditions are better for building nests every morning they fly one hundred and fifty miles into the farm and every evening they fly one hundred and fifty miles back they do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway a ninety two no kidding you know i was imagining a march of the penguins thing you know so i looked at miguel i said miguel do they fly one hundred and fifty miles to the farm and then do they fly one hundred and fifty miles back at night do they do that for the children he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song he said no they do it because the food's better you know i didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish which was delicious and i don't like fish skin i don't like it seared i don't like it crispy it's that acrid tar like flavor i almost never cook with it yet when i tasted it at that restaurant in southern spain it tasted not at all like fish skin it tasted sweet and clean like you were taking a bite of the ocean i mentioned that to miguel and he nodded he said the skin acts like a sponge it's the last defense before anything enters the body it evolved to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities okay a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators and then i realized when he says a farm that has no impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the guadalquivir river it's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants pesticide runoff and when it works its way through the system and leaves the water is cleaner than when it entered the system is so healthy it purifies the water so not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals not just a farm that measures its health health success by the health of its predators but a farm that's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish but for you and me as well because when that water leaves it dumps out into the atlantic a drop in the ocean i know but i'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good but for a lot people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us foodies we're lovers we love farmers markets we love small family farms we talk about local food we eat organic and when you suggest these are the things that will insure the future of good food someone somewhere stands up and says hey guy i love pink flamingos but how are you going to feed the world how are you going to feed the world how are you going to feed the world can i be honest i don't love that question no not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world one billion people will go hungry today one billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities in distribution not tonnage no i don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last fifty years feed grain to herbivores pesticides to monocultures chemicals to soil chicken to fish and all along agribusiness has simply asked if we're feeding more people more cheaply how terrible could that be that's been the motivation it's been the justification it's been the business plan of american agriculture we should call it what it is a business in liquidation a business that's quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible that's not a business and it isn't agriculture our bread basket is threatened today not because of diminishing supply but because of diminishing resources not by the latest combine and tractor invention but by fertile land not by pumps but by fresh water not by chainsaws but by forests and not by fishing boats and nets but by fish in the sea want to feed the world let's start by asking how are we going to feed ourselves or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself to do that don't look at the agribusiness model for the future it's really old and it's tired it's high on capital chemistry and machines and it's never produced anything really good to eat instead let's look to the ecological model that's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience farms that aren't worlds unto themselves farms that restore instead of deplete farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively farmers that are not just producers but experts in relationships because they're the ones that are experts in flavor too and if i'm going to be really honest they're a better chef than i'll ever be you know i'm okay with that because if that's the future of good food it's going to be delicious thank you

So, I've known a lot of fish in my life. I've loved only two. That first one was, it was more like a passionate affair. It was a beautiful fish. Flavorful, textured, meaty, the best seller on the menu. What a fish. Even better, It was farm raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability. So you can feel good about selling it. so you can feel good about selling it. I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months. One day, the head of the company called and asked if I'd speak at an event about the farm sustainability. Absolutely, I said, here's a company trying to solve what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs. How do we keep fish on our menus? For the past 50 years, we've been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. It's hard to overstate the destruction. the destruction. 90% of large fish, the ones we love, the tunas, the halibuts, the salmon, swordfish, they've collapsed. There's almost nothing left. So for better or for worse, aquaculture, fish farming, let's give you a part of our future. A lot of arguments against it. Fish farms, pollute. Most of them do anyway. And they're inefficient. Take tuna, a major drawback. It's got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to 1. That means it takes of 15 to 1. That means it takes 15 pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna. Not very sustainable. It doesn't taste very good either. So here, finally, was a company trying to do it right. I wanted to support him. The day before the event, I called the head of PR for the company. Let's call him Don. Don, I said just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous for farming so far out to see you. for farming so far out to see you don't pollute. That's right, he said. We're so far the waste from our fish gets distributed, not concentrated. And then he added, we're basically a world unto ourselves. A fee conversion ratio? 2.5 to one, he's said, best in the business. 2.51, great. Like 2.55, what, what do you feed him? Sustainable proteins he said, great, I said, got off the phone. And that night I was lying in bed and I thought, what the heck? lying in bed and I thought, what the hell is a sustainable protein? So the next day, just before the event, I called Don. I said, Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins? He said he didn't know. He would ask around. Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company. No one could give me a straight answer. Until finally, I go on a phone with the head biologist. Let's call him Don too. Don, I said. What are some and fish meals, and then he said chicken palettes. He said, yeah, feathers, skin, bone meal, scraps, dried, and processed into feed. I said, what percentage of your feed is chicken? Thinking, you know, 2%. Oh, it's about 30% he said, I said Don, what's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish? There is a long pause on the line, and he said there's just too much chicken in the world. I fell out of love with this chicken in the world. I fell out of love with this fish. Not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two-shoes foodie. I actually am. Now I fellout of love at this fish because I swear to God after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken. This second fish, well it's a different kind of love story. It's the romantic kind. The kind where the more you get to know your fish, you'll love the fish. I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain. A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time. She kind of set us up. Okay. It came to the taste to set us up. It came to the table a bright, almost shimmering white color. The chef had overcooked it, like twice over. Amazingly, it was still delicious. Who can make a fish taste good after it's been overcooked? I can't, but this guy can't. Let's call him Miguel, actually his name is Miguel. He didn't cook the fish and he's not a chef, at least in the way not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it. He's a biologist. At Vettelapama, it's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain. It's at the tip of the Guadalacovir River. Until the 1980s, the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians. They raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands. They did it by draining the land. They built this intricate series of canals, and they pushed water off the land and out into the river. Well, they couldn't make it work. Well, they couldn't make it work. Not economically. And ecologically, it was a disaster. Killed like 90% of the birds, which for this place is a lot of birds. And so in 1982, a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land. What did they do? They reversed the flow of water. They literally flipped the switch. Instead of pushing water out, they used the channels to pull water back in. They flooded the canals. They created a 27,000 acre fish farm. Bass, mullet, shrimp eel. Any in the process, Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction. The farm's incredible. I mean, you've never seen anything like this. You stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away and all you see are flooded canals and this thick, rich marshland. I was there not long ago with Miguel. He's an amazing guy. Like three parts, Charles Darwin, like three parts Charles Darwin and one part crocodile Dundee. Okay? There we are, slogging through the wetland. You know, I'm panting and sweating. I got mud up to my knees. And Miguel is calmly conducting a biology lecture. Here he's pointing out a rare black shoulder kite. Now he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton. And here, here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe. It turns out Miguel spent the better part of his career in the the better part of his career in the McCombie National Park in Africa. I asked him how he became such an expert on fish. Said fish. I didn't know anything about fish, I'm an expert in relationships. And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algae and strange aquatic plants, and don't get me wrong. I was really fascinated, you know, the biotic community unplugged kind of thing, it's great. But I was in love, and my head was swooning my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before. So I interrupted and I said, Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good? We pointed at the algae. I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton, the relationships, it's amazing, right? But what are your fish eating? What's the feed conversion ratio? It goes on to tell me it's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they're eating in the wild. The plant biomass, the phtoplankt, the zooplankton. The system is so healthy, it's totally self-renewing. There is no feed. Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? Unlike any farm I'd ever been at. How do you measure success? What that moment? It's as if a film director called for a set change. And we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing site. Thousands and thousands of pink flammable farms. thousands and thousands of pink flamingos. A literal pink carpet for as far as you could see. That's success, he said. Look at their bellies. Pink, they're feasting. Feasting. I was totally confused. I said, Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish? Yes, he's said. We lose 20% of our fish and fish eggs to birds. All right, well last year this property had 600,000 birds on it. More than 250 different species. It's become today the largest and one of the most important and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe. I said Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm? He shook his head, no, he said, we farm extensively, not intensively. This is an ecological network. The flamingos eat the shrimp, the shrimp eat the phytoplankton. So the pink of the belly, the better the system. Okay, so let's review. A farm that doesn't feed its animals and a farm that measures its success on the health is a success on the health of its predators. A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary. Oh, and by the way, those flamingos, they shouldn't even be there in the first place. They brewed in a town 150 miles away, where the soil conditions are better for building nests. Every morning, they fly 150 miles into the farm, and every evening, they flight 150 miles back. They do that because they're able to follow the broken white line of highway A92. No kidding. of highway A92. No kidding. I was imagining a march to the penguins thing. So I looked at Miguel. I said, Miguel, do they fly 150 miles to the farm? And then do they flight 150 miles back at night? Do they do that for the children? He looked at me like I just quoted a Whitney Houston song. He said, no, they do it because the food's better. I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish, which was delicious. And I don't like fish skin. and I don't like fish skin. I don' like it seared, I like it crispy, it's that acrid, tar-like flavor. I almost never cooked with it. Yet when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain, it tasted not at all like fiscan. It tasted sweet and clean, like you were taking a bite of the ocean. I mentioned that to Miguel and he nodded, he said, the skin acts like a sponge. It's a last defense before anything enters the body. It evolved to soak up impurities. to soak up impurities and then he added but our water has no impurities Okay, a farm that doesn't feed its fish a farm That measures the success by the success of its predators and then I realized when he says a Farm that has no Impurities he made a big understatement because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalque of your river It's a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days chemical contaminants to carry these days, chemical contaminants, pesticide runoff. And when it works its way through the system and leaves the water, it's cleaner than when it enters. The system is so healthy it purifies the water. So not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals, not just the farm that measures the health, that it's success by the health of its predators. But a farm, that's literally a water purification plant. And not just for those fish, but for you and me as well. Because when that water leaves it dumps out into the Atlantic. Drop in the ocean I know, but I'll take it I know but I'll take it and so should you because this love story however romantic is also instructive you might say it's a recipe for the future of good food whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture one in which the food actually tastes good but for a lot of people that's a bit too radical we're not realists us foodies we're lovers We love farmers markets. We love small family farms. We talk about local food. We eat organic. And when you suggest, these are the things that will ensure the future of good food. Someone somewhere stands up and says, hey guy, I love pink flamingos. But how are you gonna feed the world? How are you going to feed the World? Can I be honest? I don't love that question. that question. No, not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world. One billion people will go hungry today, one billion that's more than ever before because of gross inequalities in distribution, not tonnage. Now I don't love this question because it's determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years, feed grain to herbivores, pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil, chicken to fish, and all along agribusiness has simply asked if for feeding more people more cheaply If we're feeding more people more cheaply, how terrible could that be?

It's really old and it's tired, it's high on capital, chemistry, and machines. And it's never produced anything really good to eat. Instead, let's look to the ecological model. That's the one that relies on two billion years of on-the-job experience. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves, farms that restore, instead of deplete, farms that farm extensively instead of just extensively instead of just intensively. Farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor too. And if I'm gonna be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be. You know, I'm okay with that. Because if that's the future of good food, it's gonna be delicious. Thank you.
