 everybody talks about happiness these days i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about forty and there were many more there is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers there is a lot of happiness coaching everybody would like to make people happier but in spite of all this flood of work there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is the first of these trap is a reluctance to admit complexity it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things i think there is one particular meaning for to which we might restrict it but by and large this is something that we'll have to give up and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life and those are two very different concepts and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness and the third is it's the focusing illusion and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance i mean this is a real cognitive trap there's just no way of getting it right now i'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story and that was the story he said he'd been listening to the symphony and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording there was a dreadful screeching sound and then he added really quite emotionally it ruined the whole experience but it hadn't what it had ruined were the memory of the experience he had had the experience he had had twenty minutes of glorious music they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory the memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep what this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves there is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present is capable of re living the past but basically it has only the present it's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches you know when the doctor asks does it hurt now when i touch you here and then there is a remembering self and the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life and it's the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question how have you been feeling lately or how was your trip to albania or something like that those are two very different entities the experiencing self and the and the remembering self and getting confused between them is part of the mess of the notion of happiness now the remembering self is a storyteller and that really starts with a basic response of our memory it starts immediately we don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories our memory tells us stories that is what we get to keep from our experiences is a story and let me begin with one example this is an old study those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure i won't go into detail it's no longer painful these days but it was painful when this when this study was run in the nineteen nineties they were asked to report on their pain every sixty seconds and here are two patients those are their recordings and you are asked who of them suffered more and it's a very easy question i mean clearly patient b suffered more his colonoscopy was longer and every minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more but now there is another question how much did these patients think they suffered and here is a surprise and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than patient b the stories of the colonoscopies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but but one of them is distinct but one of them is distinctly worse than the other and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end it's a bad story how do we know that because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too how bad was the whole thing in total and it was much worse for a than for b in memory now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self from the point of view of the experiencing self clearly b had a worse time now what you could do with patient a and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much that will cause the patient to suffer but just a little and much less than before and if you do that for a couple of minutes you have made the experiencing self of patient a worse off and you have the remembering self of patient a and lot better off because now you have endowed patient a with a better story about his experience what defines a story and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us and it's also true of the stories that we make up what defines a story are changes significant moments and endings endings are very very important and in this case you know the ending dominated now the experiencing self lives its life continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever i mean most of the moments of our life and i calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long which means that you know in in a life there are about six hundred million of them in a month there are about six hundred thousand most of them don't leave a trace most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self and yet somehow you get the sense that they should count that what happens during these moments of experience is our life it's the finite resource that we're spending while we're on this earth and how to spend it would seem to be relevant but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self and they're really quite distinct the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time from the point of view of the experiencing self if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first then the two week vacation is twice as good as the one week vacation that's not the way it works at all for the remembering self for the remembering self a two week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added you have not changed the story and in this way time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self time has very little impact on this story now the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories it is actually the one that makes decisions because if you have a patient who has had say two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose then the one that chooses is the one that has you know the memory that is less bad and that's the the surgeon that will be chosen the experiencing self has no voice in this choice we actually don't choose between experiences we choose between memories of experiences and even when we think about the future we don't think of our future normally as experiences we think of our future as anticipated memories and basically you can look at this you know as a tyranny of the remembering self and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn't need i have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case that is that it's we we go on vacations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self and this is a bit hard to justify i think i mean i how much do we consume our memories that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self and when i think about that i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago which was clearly the best vacation i've ever had and i think of it relatively often relative to how much i think of other vacations and i probably have consumed my memories of that three week trip i would say for about twenty five minutes in the last four years now you know if if i had ever opened the folder with the six hundred pictures in it i would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy now i may be a bit extreme you know in how little appetite i have for consuming memories but even if you do more of this there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences so i want you to think about a thought experiment imagine that for your next vacation you know that at the end of the the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed and you'll get an amnesic drug so that you won't remember anything now would you choose the same vacation and and if and if you would choose a different vacation there is a conflict between your two selves and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict and it's actually not at all obvious because if you think in terms of time then you get one answer and if you think in terms of memories you might get another answer why do we pick them the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us you know with a choice between the two selves now the two selves bring up two notions of happiness there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply one per self and so you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how happy are the moments in the experiencing self's life and they're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process what are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self it's a completely different thing this is not about how happily a person lives it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life very different notions anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and i belong to a crowd of students of well being who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way the the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately the gallup organization has a world poll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there there have been other efforts along those lines so in recent years we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life and vice versa you know just to give you a sense of the correlation the correlation is about point five what that means is if you met somebody and you were told oh his father is six feet tall would how much would you know about his height well you would know something about his height but there's a lot of uncertainty you have that much uncertainty if i tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self so the correlation is low we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self we know that money is very important goals are very important we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like spending time with people that we like there are other pleasures but this is dominant so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves you are going to end up doing very different things the bottom line of what i've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being it is a completely different notion now very quickly another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend the same to the same things when we think about life and we actually live so if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california you are not going to get to the correct answer when you ask that question you think people must be happier in california if if say you live in ohio and what happens is when you think about living in california you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places and that contrast say is in climate well it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and is not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are but now because the reflective self is in charge you may end up some people may end up moving to california and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier well their experiencing self is not going to get happier we know that but one thing will happen they will think they are happier because when they think about it they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio and they will feel they made the right decision it is very difficult to think straight about well being and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is thank you sure i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number which we absolutely did not expect to find we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self when you know we looked at how at how feelings vary with income and it turns out that below an income of sixty thousand dollars a year for americans and that's a very large sample of americans like six hundred thousand so it's a large representative sample below an income of six hundred thousand dollars a year sixty thousand sixty thousand sixty thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get above that we get an absolutely flat line i mean i've rarely seen lines so flat clearly what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness but lack of money certainly buys you misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you earn the more satisfied you are that does not hold for emotions you know i think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy the recognition is going to be slow in the united states no question about that but in the uk it is happening and in other countries it is happening people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy of happiness when they think of public policy it's going to take a while and it's not going to and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life evaluation so we need to have that debate fairly soon how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self this is going to influence policy i think in years to come in the united states efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population this is going to be i think within the next decade or two part of national statistics

Whisper transcription:
Everybody talks about happiness these days. I had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years, and they gave up after about 40 and there were many more. There is a huge wave of interest in happiness among researchers, there is a lot of happiness coaching, everybody would like to make people happier, but in spite of all this flood of work, there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness. impossible to think straight about happiness. And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps. This applies to lay people thinking about their own happiness and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness because it turns out we're dressed as messed up as anybody else's. The first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity. It turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply to too many different things. I think there is one particular things. I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it, but by and large, this is something that we'll have to give up and will have to adopt a more complicated view of what well-being is. The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory. Basically, it's between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life. And those are two very different concepts, and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness. And the third the notion of happiness. And the third is, it's the focusing illusion. And it's unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance that effects will be without distorting its importance. I mean, this is a real cognitive trap. There's just no way of getting it right. Now, I'd like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lectures reported a story, and that was a story. He said he had been listening to a He said he had been listening to a symphony, and it was absolutely glorious music. And at the very end of the recording, there was a dreadful screeching sound. And then he added, really quite emotionally, it ruined the whole experience. But it hadn't. When it had ruined, when the memory of the experience, he had had the experience. He had had 20 minutes of glorious music, they counted for nothing, because he was left with a memory because he was left with a memory. The memory was ruined and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. What this is telling us really is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves. There is an experiencing self who lives in the present and knows the present, capable of reliving the past, but basically it has only the present. It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches, that the doctor approaches, you know, when the doctor asks, does it hurt now when I touch you here? And then there is a remembering self. And the remembering self is the one that keeps score and maintains the story of our life. And it's the one, that the Doctor approaches in asking the question, how have you been feeling lately or how has your trip to Albania or something like that? Those are two very different entities, the experiencing self, entities, the experiencing self and the remembering self, and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness. Now, remembering self is a storyteller. And that really starts with a basic response of our memory. It starts immediately. We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories. Our memory tells our stories. That is, what we get to keep from our experiences is a story. from our experiences is a story. And let me begin with one example. This is an old study. Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure. I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days, but it was painful when the study was run in the 1990s. There has to report on their pain every 60 seconds. And here are two patients, those are their recordings. And you are asked who of them suffered? us who of them suffered more? And it's a very easy question. I mean, clearly patient B suffered more. Is colonoscopy was longer and every minute of pain that patient A had, patient B had, and more? But now there is another question. How much did these patients think they suffered? And here is a surprise. And the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colonoscopied than patient B. The stories of the the stories of the colonoscopies were different. And because a very critical part of the story is how it ends. And neither these stories is very inspiring or great, but one of them is distinctly worse than the other. And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end. It's a bad story. How do we know that? Because we ask these people after their Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy and much later too, how bad was the whole thing in total? And it was much worse for A than for B in memory. Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self. From the point of view of the experiencing itself, clearly B had a worse time. Now what you could do with patient A, and we actually ran clinical experiments and it has been done and it does work, has been done and it does work, you could actually extend the colonoscopy of patient A by just keeping the tube in without juggling it too much. That will cause the patient to suffer, but just a little, and much less than before. And if you do that for a couple of minutes, you have made the experiencing self-of-patient A worse off, and you've made the remembering self of patient a lot better off. Because now you have endowed patient because now you have endowed patient A with a better story about his experience. What defines a story, and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us, and it's also true of stories that we make up. When they find a story out, changes significant moments and endings. Endings are very, very important, and in this case, you know, the ending dominated. Now, the experiencing self experiencing self lives its life continuously it has moments of experience one after the other and you can ask what happens to these moments and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever I mean most of the moments of our life and I calculated you know the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that you know and in a life there are about 600 million of them in a month there about 600 thousand most of them don't And yet, somehow you get the sense that they should count, that what happens during these moments of experience is our life. It's the finite resource that we are spending while we are on this earth. And how to spend it would seem to be relevant, but that is not the story that a remembering self keeps for us. So we have the understanding that we need to be able to for us. So we have the remembering self and the experiencing self, and they're really quite distinct. The biggest difference between them is in the handling of time. From the point of view of the experiencing itself, if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first, then the two week vacation is twice as good, as the one week vacation. That's not the way it works at all, for the remembering Remembering self, the two-week vacation is barely better than the one week vacation because there are no new memories added. You have not trained the story. And in this way, time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from our experiencing. Time has very little impact on the story, now, the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories. It is, actually, the one that makes the decision. the one that makes the surgeons. Because if you have a patient who has had, say, two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose, then the ones that chooses are the ones with the memory that is less bad. And that's the surgeon that will be chosen. The experiencing self has no voice in this choice. We actually don't choose between experiences. We choose between memories of experience. We choose between memories of experiences. And even when we think about the future, we don't think of our future normally as experiences. We think about future as anticipated memories. And basically, you can look at this, you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self, and you can think of remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self to experiences that the experiencing itself doesn't need. I had that sense that when we go on the that when we go on vacations, this is very frequently the case, that is, that it's, we go invocations to a very large extent in the service of our remembering self. And this is a bit how to justify, I think. I mean, how much do we consume our memories? That is one of the explanation that is given for the dominance of the remembering self, and when I think about that, I'd think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago, which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had, the best vacation I've ever had and I think of it relatively often relative to how much I think about the vacations and I probably have consumed my memories of that three-week trip I would say for about 25 minutes in the last four years now you know if I had ever opened the folder with a 600 pictures in it I would have spent another hour now that is three weeks and that is at most an hour and a half there seems to be a discrepancy there seems to be a discrepancy. Now, I may be a bit extreme in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question. Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences? So, I want you to think about a thought experiment. Imagine that for your next vacation, you know that at the end of the vacation, that the end of the vacation, all your pictures will be destroyed, and you'll get an amnesic drug, so that you won't remember anything. Now, would you choose the same vacation? And if you would choose a different vacation, there is a conflict between your two cells. And you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict, and it's actually not at all obvious, because if you think in terms of time, then Then you get one answer. And if you think in terms of memories, you might get another answer. Why do we pick the vacations we do? Is a problem that confronts us, you know, with the choice between the two cells. Now, the 2 cells bring up two notions of happiness. There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply, one per cell. And so you can ask how happy is the So you can ask how happy is the experiencing self and then you would ask how Happy are the moments in the experiencing? Self's life and they're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process What are the emotions that can be measured and by the way now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing Self over time if you ask for the happiness or the remembering Self It's a completely different thing. This is not about different thing. This is not about how happy a person lives. It is about how satisfied or pleased a person is when that person thinks about her life. Very different notions. Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being who've been messing up the studies of happiness for a long time in precisely this way. The distinction between the happiness between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years and there are now efforts to measure the two separately. The Gallup organization has a world poll with more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences and there have been other efforts along those lines. So in recent year we have begun to learn about the happiness about the happiness of the two selves. And the main lesson I think that we have learned is that they're really different. You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life, and that really doesn't teach you much about how happily they're living their life. And vice versa, you know, just to give you a sense of the correlation. The correlation is about point five. What that means is if you met somebody and you were told, or his father is six feet tall, father is six feet tall. How much would you know about his height? Well, you would know something about this height, but there is a lot of uncertainty. You have that much uncertainty. If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten, you have a lot uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self. So, the correlation is low. We know some thing about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self. we know that money is very important, goals are very important. We know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like, spending time with people we like. There are other pleasures, but this is dominant. So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves, you are going to end up doing very different things. The bottom line of what I've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute. as a substitute for well-being. It is a completely different notion. Now, very quickly, another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life and we actually live. So if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California, you are not going to get to the correct answer. When you ask that question, you think people must be happy. Mass that question you think people must be happier in California. If say you live in Ohio. And what happens is when you think about living in California, you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places. And that contrast says in climate. Well, it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self. And it's not even very important a reflective self that decides how happy people are. But now, because the reflective self is in charge, some people may end up moving to California, and it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California and the hope of getting happier. Well, their experiencing self is not going to get happier. We know that. But one thing will happen, they will think they are happier, because when they think Because when they think about it, they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio. And they will feel they made the right decision. It is very difficult to think straight about well-being. And I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is. Thank you. Sure. I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find. We found that with respect to the We found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self. When, you know, we looked at how feelings vary with income. And it turns out that below an income of $60,000 a year, for Americans, and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000. So it's a lot of representative sample. Below an income, a $600,000 the year. 60,000, 60-thousand dollars a year. People are unhappy. thousand dollars a year people are unhappy and they get progressively unhappy the poorer they get above that we get an absolutely flat line I mean I've really seen lines so flat clearly what is happening is Money does not buy you experiential happiness, but lack of money certainly buys you misery and we can measure that misery very very clearly in terms of the the other self the remembering self you get a different story the more money you are the more satisfied money you are, the most satisfied you are. That does not hold for emotions. You know, I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy. The recognition is going to be slow in the United States. No question about that. But in the UK, it is happening. And in other countries, this is happening, people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of policy of happiness when they think of public policy, it's going to take a while. And it's not going to, and people are going to debate whether they And people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they wanted to study life evaluation. So we need to have that debate fairly soon. How to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think and whether you think of the remembering self or you think about the experiencing self. This is going to influence policy I think in years to come. In the United States efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population. within the next decade or two, part of national statistics.
