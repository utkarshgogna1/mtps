Original text:
 i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction in high school i i took a bus to school an hour each way every day and i was always absorbed in a book science fiction book which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in in a in a narrative form this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had and and you know that curiosity also manifested itself in in the fact that whenever i wasn't in school i was i was out in the woods hiking and taking samples frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back looking at it under the microscope i was you know i was a real science geek but it was all about trying to understand understand the world understand the the limits of of possibility and my you know love of of science fiction actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me because what was happening this is in the late sixties you know we were we were going to the moon we were exploring the deep oceans jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a you know a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined so that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it and i was a an artist i could draw i could paint and and i i found that because there weren't you know video games and this saturation of cg movies and and all of this imagery in the media landscape i had to create these images in my head you know we all did as kids having to read a book and through the author's description put something on on the screen the movie screen in our heads and so my response to this was to paint to draw alien creatures alien worlds robots spaceships all that stuff i was endlessly getting busted in math class you know doodling behind the behind the textbook and that was the creativity had to had to find its outlet somehow and an interesting thing happened the the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that that seemed pretty pretty darn unlikely but i could that was a world i could really go to right here on earth that was as as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books so i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of fifteen and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada six hundred miles from the nearest ocean but i didn't let that daunt me i pestered my father until he finally found a a scuba class in in buffalo new york right across the border from where we live and i actually got certified in a pool in a ymca in the dead of winter in buffalo new york and i didn't see the ocean a a real ocean for another two years until we until we moved to california you know since then you know in in the in the intervening forty years i've i've spent about three thousand hours underwater and five hundred hours of that was in submersibles and i've learned that that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with with amazing life that really is beyond beyond our imagination you know nature's imagination is so so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination i still to this day stand in absolute awe of what i what i see when i make these dives and my love affair with the ocean is is ongoing and and just as strong as it ever was but when i when i chose a career as an adult it was film making and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my my urges to create images and i was as a kid constantly drawing comic books and so on so film making was the way to put put pictures and stories together and that made sense and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator aliens and the abyss and with the abyss i i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with film making so you know merging the two passions something interesting came out of the abyss which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film which was to create this kind of liquid water creature we actually embraced computer generated animation cg and this this resulted in the first soft surface character cg animation that was ever in a in a movie and even though the film didn't make any money barely broke even i should say i witnessed something amazing which is that the the audience the global audience was mesmerized by this apparent magic you know it's arthur clarke's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic they were seeing something magical and so that that that got me very excited and i thought wow this is this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art so with terminator two which was my next film we took that much farther working with with ilm we created the liquid metal dude in that film the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work and it did and we created magic again and we had the same result with an audience although we did make a little more money on that one so you know drawing a line through those those two two dots of of experience came to this this is going to be a whole new world this was a whole new world of creativity for for film artists so i i started a company with stan winston my good friend stan winston who is the the the premier make up and and creature designer at that time and it was called digital domain and the concept of the company was that we would leap frog past the kind of analog processes of of optical printers and so on and we would go right to digital production and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while but we found ourselves lagging in the in the mid nineties in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do so i wrote this piece called avatar which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects of cg effects beyond with realistic human emotive characters generated in cg and the main characters would all be in cg and the world would be in cg and you know the envelope pushed back and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while so i shelved it and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks and you know i i went and pitched it to the studio as romeo and juliet on a ship it's going to be this epic romance passionate film secretly what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic and that's why i made the movie and that's the truth now the studio didn't know that but i convinced them i said i said we're going to dive to the wreck we're going to film it for real we'll be using it in the opening of the film it will be really important it will be a great marketing hook and i talked them into funding an expedition sounds crazy but this goes back to that theme about you know your imagination creating a reality because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north atlantic looking at the real titanic through through a view port not a movie not hd for real now that that blew my mind and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission you know where it was it was highly technical and it required enormous planning you get in this capsule you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself and you know i i thought wow i'm i'm like living in a science fiction movie this is really cool and so i i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration of course the curiosity the science component of it it was everything it was adventure it was curiosity it was imagination and it was an experience that hollywood couldn't give me because you know i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it but i couldn't imagine what i was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions i was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and and sometimes things that i had had never seen before sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them so i was completely smitten by this and had to do more and so i actually made a kind of curious decision after the success of titanic i said okay you know i'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker and i'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while and so you know we started planning these these expeditions and we wound up going to the bismark and and exploring it with with robotic vehicles we went back to the titanic wreck we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship which had never been done nobody had ever looked inside the wreck they didn't have the means to do it so we created technology to do it so you know here i am now on the deck of titanic sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this where i knew that the that the band had played and i'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the through the corridor of the of the ship you know when i say you know i'm i'm i'm operating it but my mind is in the vehicle i felt like i was physically present inside the shipwreck of titanic and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience i've i've ever had because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship so it was this absolutely remarkable experience and it really made me realize that made me realize that the the telepresense experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars then your consciousness is is in injected into the into the vehicle into this this other form of existence it was really really quite profound and maybe a little bit of a glimpse to to what might be happening you know some decades out as as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in in many sort of post human futures that i that i can imagine as a science fiction fan so having done these these expeditions and and you know really beginning to appreciate what was down there such as at the at the the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing amazing animals they are basically aliens right here on earth they live in an environment of chemosynthesis they don't survive on sunlight based system the way we do and so you're seeing animals that are living next to a five hundred degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can't possibly exist at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well again you know it's the science fiction influence as a kid and i wound up getting involved with the space community really involved with with nasa sitting on the nasa advisory board planning actual space missions going to russia going to the pre cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the international space station with our three d camera systems and this was fascinating but what what i wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep and taking them down so that they had access astrobiologists planetary scientists people who were interested in these extremely fine environments taking them down to the vents and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on so here we were making documentary films but actually doing science and actually doing space science i'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan you know as a kid and doing this stuff for real and you know along the way in this journey of discovery i learned a lot i learned a lot about science but i also learned a lot about leadership now you think directors got to be a leader leader of you know captain of the ship and all that sort of thing i didn't really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions because i had to at a certain point say what am i doing out here why am i doing this what do i get out of it we don't make money at these damn shows you know we barely break even there is no fame in it people sort of think i went away between titanic and avatar and was buffing my nails someplace you know sitting at the beach made all these films made all these documentary films you know for a very limited audience no fame no glory no money what are you doing you're doing it for the task itself for the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is for the thrill of discovery and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team because we would do these things with ten twelve people working for years at a time sometimes at sea for for for two or three months at a time and in that bond you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else when you come back to the shore and you say you know we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attentuation and the this and the that all the all the technology of it and the difficulty the human performance aspects of working at sea you can't explain it to people it's that thing that that maybe cops have or people in in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it creates a bond creates a bond of respect so when i came back to make my next movie which was avatar i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return and it really changed the dynamic so here i was again with a small team in you know in uncharted territory doing avatar coming up with new technology that didn't exist before tremendously exciting tremendously challenging and we became a family over a four and half year period and it completely changed how i do movies so people have commented on how well you know you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pandora to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business the process itself that changed as a result of that so what can we synthesize out of all this you know what's the what are the lessons learned well i think number one is curiosity it's the most powerful thing you own imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world i have young film makers come up to me and say you know give me some advice for doing this and i say don't put limitations on yourself other people will do that for you don't do it to yourself don't bet against yourself and and take risks nasa has this has this phrase that they like failure is not an option but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk you have to be willing to take those risks so that's the thought i would leave you with is that in whatever you're doing failure is an option but fear is not thank

Whisper transcription:
I grew up on steady diet of science fiction. In high school, I took a bus to school an hour each way every day. And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds and satisfied this in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. And that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever in the fact that whenever I was in school, I was out in the woods hiking and taking samples, frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope. I was a real science geek, but it was all about trying to understand the world, understand the limits of possibility. And my love of science fiction actually seemed to be mirrored in the world around me, in the world around me, because what was happening, this was in the late 60s, we were going to the moon. We were exploring the deep oceans. Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places, and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined. So that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it. And I was an artist. I could draw a paint, and I found that and I found that because there weren't video games and the saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head. We all did, as kids having to read a book and through the author's description, put something on the movie screen in our heads. And so my response to this was to paint, to draw alien creatures, alien worlds, robots, spaceships, all that stuff. I was endlessly getting all that stuff. I was endlessly getting busted in math class, you know, doodling behind the textbook. And that was, the creativity had to find its outlet somehow. And an interesting thing happened, the Jacques Cousteau shows. It actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth. I might not really go to an alien World on a spaceship someday. That seemed pretty darn unlikely. darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books. So I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15. And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me. I pastured my father until he finally found a Scuba class in Buffalo, New York, right across the border. in Buffalo, New York right across the border from where we live. Then I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo New York. And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean for another two years until we moved to California. And now since then, you know, in the intervening 40 years, I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater, and 500 hours of that was in submersibles, and I've learned that that and I've learned that that deep ocean environment and even the shallow oceans are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination. Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination. I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives. And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing and just as strong as it ever was. going and just as strong as it ever was. But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking. And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images. And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books and so on. So filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together, and that made sense. And of course, the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories, Terminator Aliens. fiction stories, Terminator Aliens, and then the Abyss. And with the abyss, I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking. So, you know, merging the two passions, something interesting came out of The Abyss which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film, which was to create this kind of liquid water creature, we actually embraced computer-generated animation. computer generated animation, CG. And this resulted in the first soft surface character CG animation that was ever in a movie. And even though the film didn't make any money, barely broke even, I should say. I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic. It's Arthur Clark's law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from technology is indistinguishable from magic. They were seeing something magical. And so that got me very excited. And I thought, wow, this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art. So with Terminator 2, which was my next film, we took that much farther. Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude in that film. And the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work. And it did, and we created magic again. And we had the same result with an audience, although we did make a little more money on that one. We didn't make a little more money on that one. So, you know, drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to, this is gonna be a whole new world. This is a whole New World of Creativity for film artists. So I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston who was the premier makeup and creature designer at that time and it was called Digital Domain. And the concept of the company And the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog pass the kind of analog processes of optical printers and so on, and we would go right to digital production. And we actually did that, and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. But we found ourselves lagging in the mid-90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do. So I wrote this piece called Avatar, which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of envelope of visual effects, of CG effects, beyond with realistic human and motive characters generated in CG and the main characters that all be in CG. The envelope pushed back and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. So I shelved it and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks. And, you know, I went in and pitched it to the studio as Romeo and Juliet on a ship. It's going to be this epic romance, passionate film. Secretly, what I wanted to do was I want it to dive to the real wreck of Titanic, and that's why I made the movie. And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that, but I convinced them. I said, I said we're going to die to the wreck, we're gonna film it for real, we'll be using it in the opening of the film. It'll be really important, it'll be a great marketing hook, and I talked them into funding and expedition. Sounds crazy. It sounds crazy, but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality. Because it actually created a reality where at six months later I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the North Atlantic looking at the real Titanic through a viewport, not a movie, not HD for real. Now that blew my mind. And it took a lot of preparation. We had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space deep dives was like a space mission, you know, where it was highly technical and required enormous planning. And you get in this capsule, you go down to this dark, hostile environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can't get back by yourself. And I've thought, wow, I'm like living in a science fiction movie. This is really cool. And so I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it, it was everything. It was adventure. It was adventure, it was curiosity, was imagination, and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me. Because, you know, I can imagine a creature, and we could create a visual effect for it, but I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window as we did some of our subsequent expeditions. I was seen creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before, sometimes, things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and image them. that we saw them and image them. So I was completely smitten by this and had to do more. And so I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of Titanic, I said, OK, you know, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm gonna go be a full-time explorer for a while. So we started planning these expeditions, and we wound up going to the Bismarck and exploring it with robotic vehicles, with robotic vehicles. We went back to the Titanic wreck. We took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic, and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship, which had never been done. Nobody ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it. So we created technology to do. So here I am now on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played, that the band had played, and I'm flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship. You know, when I say, you know, I'm operating it, but my mind is in the vehicle. I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic, and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I've ever had, because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there, before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it. revealed it, because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship. So there was this absolutely remarkable experience, and it really made me realize that, you know, the telepresence experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars, then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle, into this other form of existence. And it was really, really quite profound. And maybe a little bit of a glimpse to And maybe a little bit of a glimpse to what might be happening, you know, some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means. And in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine as a science fiction fan. So having done these expeditions and really beginning to appreciate what was down there, such as at the deep ocean vents at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing, amazing animals. They're basically aliens right here on Earth. They live in an environment of chemosynthesis. They don't survive on sunlight-based system the way we do. And so you're seeing animals that are living next to a 500-degree centigrade water plumes that you think they can't possibly exist. At the same time, I was getting very interested in space science as well. Again, you know, it's the science fiction influence as a kid. the science fiction influence as a kid. And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA Advisory Board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols and all these sorts of things to actually go and fly to the International Space Station with our 3D camera systems. And this was fascinating, but what I ended up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep. into the deep and taking them down so that they had access, astrobiologists, planetary scientists, people who are interested in these extreme of file environments, taking them to the events and letting them see and take samples and test instruments and so on. So here we were making documentary films, but actually doing science and actually doing space science. I completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid and doing this stuff for real. stuff for real. And, you know, along the way, in this journey of discovery, I learned a lot. I learn a lot about science, but I also learned a little lot about leadership. And you think directors got to be a leader, leader of captain of the ship, all that sort of thing. I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions. Because I had to, at a certain point, say, what am I doing out here? Why am i doing this? What do I get out of it? What do I get out of it? We don't make money at these damn shows. You know, we barely break even. There's no fame in it. People sort of think I went away between Titanic and Avatar and was buffing my nails someplace, you know, sitting at the beach. Made all these films, made all these documentary films that you know for a very limited audience. So no fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing? You're doing it for the task itself. For the challenge and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is. for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team, because we would do these things with 10, 12 people working for years at a time. Sometimes that's C for two, three months at the time. And in that bond, you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you, that you've done a task that you can't explain to someone else. that you can't explain to someone else. When you come back to the shore and you say, you know, we had to do this and the fiber optic and the attenuation and this and that, all the technology of it and the difficulty, the human performance aspects of working at sea, you can explain it to people. It's that thing that maybe cops have or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it. Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect. So when I came back to make my next movie, which was Avatar, I tried to apply that same principle try to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team and you earn their respect in return. And it really changed the dynamic. So here I was again with a small team and an uncharted territory doing avatar, coming up with new technology that didn't exist before, tremendously exciting, tremendously challenging, and we became a family over a four and a half year period and it completely changed how I do movies. So people have commented on how you brought back the old how you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora. To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business, the process itself that changed as a result of that. So what can we synthesize out of all this? What are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is curiosity. It's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say give me some advice for doing this. And I say don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you. Don't do it to yourself, don't bet against yourself. And take risks. NASA has this phrase that they like. as this phrase that they like, failure is not an option, but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration because it's a leap of faith and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. So that's the thought I would leave you with. Is that in whatever you're doing, failure, is an option. But fear is not. Thank you.
